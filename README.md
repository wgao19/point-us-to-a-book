## Context

Dan [tweeted this](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1190762799338790913?s=20):

![Please point me to a book about programming that: - isn‚Äôt boring - isn‚Äôt focused on algorithms and data structures - isn‚Äôt fluffy advice like ‚Äúwrite clean codes‚Äù Thanks](https://i.imgur.com/O152ima.png)

Because I like reading a lot but I haven't read many technical books, I browsed through the discussion and [curated a list of books I'd like to read](https://aworkinprogress.dev/dan's-thread-on-interesting-books/), [and tweeted about this](https://twitter.com/wgao19/status/1190967709036531713?s=20). Then Dan retweeted it and that post rocketed.

I then feel it would work better if this becomes a collective thing. After all, reading is a personal thing and my personal list may not make sense for others. But having a list that our community collectively recommend may be a good idea. You can then fork it to become your own, star or watch it, or PR to add more.

## Contributing

Feel free to PR to add more books or append your recommendations. Personally I find attaching a one-liner recommendation very helpful - it's an intro in your minds to people who've never read it before.

### A simple style guide

```markdown
- **Title** by _author name_ and _another author name_  
  [link to amazon](#) [link to goodreads](#)  
  - why I recommend this book [name (optional)](#optional-link-to-tweet)  
```

- book has official website - put link on that book
- separate links to amazon / goodreads on second line
- this trick in markdown: two spaces at the end of the line + new line will break line.

  One of the authors once helped me on one of my problems around Flow. Later on I learned that the gradually typed system is more interesting than just semicolon number string object so I wanted to read more about this.
- **Working Effectively with Legacy Code** by _Michael Feathers_  
  [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052) | [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44919.Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code)

- [**Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming**](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide) by _Professor Frisby_

## Likely a lot of math

  also multiple mentions  
  "_Its not about one programming language, but does cover concepts relevant to all programmers._" ([tweet](https://twitter.com/jonathaneckman4/status/1190796774329536517?s=20))

- **The Culture Code** by _Daniel Coyle_  
  [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Culture-Code-Secrets-Highly-Successful/dp/B077B1WF85) | [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33517721-the-culture-code)  
  Fast and interesting read on how effective groups collaborate.
- **Godel, Escher, Bach** (a.k.a. "GED") by _Douglas Hofstadter_  
  [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567) | [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach)  
  Brilliant work on three geniuses. Bach in particular is my lifetime idol (in terms of creativity, not in terms of how many kids he have). And I find this conversation very amusing:

- **Where Wizards Stay Up Late** by _Katie Hafner_  
  [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Where-Wizards-Stay-Up-Late/dp/0684832674) | [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/281818.Where_Wizards_Stay_Up_Late)

  Very interesting read in math on the topics of formal logic, even has an answer to the question of artificial v.s. human intelligence. TIL GED's author is an editor & collaborator for this book.

- **Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality** by Eliezer Yudkowsky  
  [official site](http://www.hpmor.com/) | [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10016013-harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality)
  
  This book is not about the programming itself, but about science and methods of rationality. It may be extremely interesting for people with a technical mindset (doubly interesting if you are a fan of the Harry Potter Saga).

- **Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!** by Richard P. Feynman  
  [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041) | [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5544.Surely_You_re_Joking_Mr_Feynman_)
  
  An interesting life story of one of the greatest physicist of the last century.
