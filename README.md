## Context

Dan [tweeted this](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1190762799338790913?s=20):

![Please point me to a book about programming that: - isn’t boring - isn’t focused on algorithms and data structures - isn’t fluffy advice like “write clean codes” Thanks](https://i.imgur.com/O152ima.png)

Because I like reading a lot but I haven't read many technical books, I browsed through the discussion and [curated a list of books I'd like to read](https://aworkinprogress.dev/dan's-thread-on-interesting-books/), [and tweeted about this](https://twitter.com/wgao19/status/1190967709036531713?s=20). Then Dan retweeted it and that post rocketed.

I then feel it would work better if this becomes a collective thing. After all, reading is a personal thing and my personal list may not make sense for others. But having a list that our community collectively recommend may be a good idea. You can then fork it to become your own, star or watch it, or PR to add more.

## Contributing

Feel free to PR to add more books or append your recommendations. Personally I find attaching a one-liner recommendation very helpful - it's an intro in your minds to people who've never read it before.

### A simple style guide

```markdown
- **Title** by _author name_ and _another author name_  
  [link to amazon](#) [link to goodreads](#)  
  - why I recommend this book [name (optional)](#optional-link-to-tweet)  
```

- book has official website - put link on that book
- separate links to amazon / goodreads on second line
- this trick in markdown: two spaces at the end of the line + new line will break line.

- [**Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming**](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide) by _Professor Frisby_

  Brilliant work on three geniuses. Bach in particular is my lifetime idol (in terms of creativity, not in terms of how many kids he have). And I find this conversation very amusing:
